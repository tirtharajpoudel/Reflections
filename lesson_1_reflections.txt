How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me the differences in the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to see older versions and help to play with the file and code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    While doing it manually, there will be a exact logical change, whereas in google there are just some random changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git tracks projects where files are interrelated whereas in google docs the files are not completely related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log // shows the complete log or history of the file.
    git diff commit_id1 commit_id2 // shows the difference in two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If anything happens wrong I could simply switch to the older version of my project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my college and future projects.
