When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work with other people on my project and share my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because manually pulling changes help to publish a more logical version update than automatic update by git.It also helps to pervent the leak of new features in your project.
