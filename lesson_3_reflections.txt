When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work with other people on my project and share my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because manually pulling changes help to publish a more logical version update than automatic update by git.It also helps to pervent the leak of new features in your project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork - to share a repository with myself and commit changes when I don't have permissions to commit to the original repository. (Give credit to the original auther)
	Clone - to copy a repository offline.
	Branch - to create a new platform to experiment new features, fix bug without disturbing the original code.
